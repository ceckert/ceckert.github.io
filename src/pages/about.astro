        I'm a software developer based in Bend, Oregon. I've been building things
        on the web for a long time, most recently working with Vue and Firebase. These days I'm
        especially interested in what's happening with AI and how it's changing the way we build software.

      <p class="mb-4">
        Outside of code, I spend a lot of time thinking about healthspan -- how to stay sharp and
        physically capable for as long as possible. That means paying attention to diet, exercise,
        sleep, and mental health. I'm a big believer in the idea that optimizing for longevity and
        optimizing for performance are mostly the same thing.

        I'm also on a self-actualization kick. Lifelong learning, challenging comfort zones, trying to
        be a little better than yesterday. Pretty typical nerd from the 80s who grew up on computers
        and never stopped being curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is where I write about all of it -- software, AI, health, mental models, and
        whatever else I'm exploring. If any of that sounds interesting, stick around.
