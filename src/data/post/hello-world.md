It's been a while.

I've had a personal site in various states of neglect for years -- Jekyll, Hugo experiments, the usual graveyard of good intentions. Today I'm starting fresh with [Astro](https://astro.build), and this time the goal is simple: just write.

I'm a software developer in Bend, Oregon. I've spent most of my career building things on the web, most recently with Vue and Firebase. But my interests go well beyond code. Lately I've been deep into:

- **AI and software** -- the tooling is changing fast and I want to think out loud about it
- **Healthspan** -- diet, exercise, sleep, and what the research actually says about living well for longer
- **Mental health** -- the intersection of performance, self-awareness, and just being a functional human
- **Self-actualization** -- lifelong learning, uncomfortable growth, trying to be a little better each day

Basically, I'm a nerd from the 80s who never stopped being curious. This is the space where I'll share what I'm learning, building, and thinking about.

If any of that resonates, welcome aboard. More to come.
