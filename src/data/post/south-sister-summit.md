Living in Bend means South Sister is always on the horizon -- literally. At 10,358 feet, it's the third-tallest peak in Oregon and one of those hikes that locals talk about like a rite of passage. This September, I finally made the push to the top.

## The Route

I took the standard route from Devils Lake trailhead. It's roughly 12 miles round trip with about 4,900 feet of elevation gain. Not technical, but relentless. The trail is well-marked through the forest for the first couple of miles, then breaks into open volcanic terrain that just goes up and up.

## The Climb

Started early to beat the afternoon weather. The lower section through the trees is pleasant enough, but the real work begins once you hit the moraine -- miles of loose volcanic scree where every step forward slides you half a step back. It's the kind of terrain that tests your patience as much as your legs.

Above the Lewis Glacier the air thins noticeably and the wind picks up. The final push to the summit ridge is steep and exposed, but you can see the crater lake below and the views start to open up in every direction.

## The Summit

Worth every step. From the top you can see the entire Cascade chain -- Broken Top right next door, Bachelor to the south, Jefferson and Hood to the north. The crater lake sits below the rim, still holding patches of ice even in September. It's one of those views that makes you just stand there and not say anything for a while.

## Lessons Learned

- **Start early.** I was on the trail by 6am and glad I was. The afternoon clouds rolled in right as I was descending.
- **Poles are not optional.** The scree sections are brutal on the knees, especially on the way down.
- **Bring more water than you think.** The dry volcanic terrain and elevation combine to dehydrate you fast.
- **Layer up.** It was 70 degrees at the trailhead and felt like 35 on the summit with wind chill.

If you're in Central Oregon and haven't done this one yet, put it on the list. It's a long day, but standing on top of a volcano in your own backyard is hard to beat.
